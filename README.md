# K-Means-Clustering-101-World-Happiness-Report


# Importance of The Project

The report incorporates analysis by experts in economics, neuroscience and statistics, and shows how measurements of well-being can be used to evaluate a country’s progress. General assessments of individuals’ whole lives as well as data about their emotional experiences were collected and considered.

The happiness ranking of countries was determined by asking individuals to evaluate their lives as a whole, according to six variables. Respondents scored them on a scale of 0 to 10.

1. GDP per capita, i.e. purchasing power
2. Social support (having someone to count on in troubled times)
3. Healthy life expectancy,
4. Freedom to make life decisions,
5. Generosity (donations to charity)
6. Perceptions of corruption

Why one society has strong social capital while another does not remains a mystery, but there are ways to actively promote social capital. 
The report’s recommendations include: Provide moral training in school, universal access to education and specialized training in compassion; 
establish codes of ethics for different professions and governmental regulations against anti-social behavior; reduce corruption and income equality,
and adopt strong social safety nets.

Cluster 2: countries that have GDP in the range of 0.6 to 1.4 and have high social support. 
These countries have medium life expectancy and have high freedom to make life choices. 
These counties have low generosity and low perception of corruption.

Cluster 1: countries that have very high GDP, high social support and high life expectancy. 
These counties have high freedom to make life choices, medium generosity and medium perception of corruption.

Cluster 0: countries that have low GDP average life expectancy and average social support.
These counties have low freedom to make life choices, high generosity and medium perception of corruption.
